# Rule Engine Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

I've successfully created a comprehensive, flexible rule engine application in Ruby based on your requirements from `Context.md`. The rule engine allows you to create and chain rules into rulesets, define input models, and apply rules with transaction support.

## ✅ Completed Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Rule Creation & Management**: Create individual rules with conditions and outcomes
- ✅ **Rule Chaining**: Chain rules using Chain of Responsibility pattern
- ✅ **Rule Sets**: Group related rules with different evaluation strategies
- ✅ **Input Model Support**: Flexible `ViolationContext` for rule evaluation
- ✅ **Transaction Support**: Execute rules within transaction scopes
- ✅ **Multiple Evaluation Strategies**: First-match, collect-all, and custom strategies

### Advanced Features
- ✅ **DSL Support**: Domain-specific language for defining rules
- ✅ **Configuration Loading**: Load rules from YAML/JSON files
- ✅ **Action Handlers**: Decoupled action execution system
- ✅ **Event Dispatching**: Observer pattern for outcome handling
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: Built-in audit trail and error handling
- ✅ **Rule Management**: Enable/disable rules dynamically
- ✅ **Custom Outcomes**: Extensible outcome system
- ✅ **Performance Monitoring**: Statistics and execution tracking

### Design Patterns Implemented
- ✅ **Rules Engine Pattern**: Core pattern for business rule evaluation
- ✅ **Chain of Responsibility**: For rule chaining and evaluation order
- ✅ **Strategy Pattern**: For different evaluation strategies
- ✅ **Observer Pattern**: For event dispatching
- ✅ **Command Pattern**: For action execution
- ✅ **Builder Pattern**: For DSL rule construction

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Start
```ruby
require 'rule_engine'

# Create engine
engine = RuleEngine::RuleEngine.new

# Register handlers
engine.register_handlers(
  RuleEngine::PenaltyHandler.new,
  RuleEngine::AccountSuspensionHandler.new,
  RuleEngine::NotificationHandler.new
)

# Create rules
rule = RuleEngine::Rule.new(
  name: 'high_severity_fraud',
  condition: ->(context) { context.severity >= 8 },
  outcomes: [->(context) { RuleEngine::SuspendAccount.new(context) }]
)

# Create rule set
rule_set = RuleEngine::RuleSet.new(name: 'fraud_detection', rules: [rule])
engine.add_rule_set(rule_set)

# Evaluate rules
context = RuleEngine::ViolationContext.new(type: :fraud, severity: 9, user_id: 123)
result = engine.evaluate_and_dispatch('fraud_detection', context)
```

### Using DSL
```ruby
class ViolationProcessor
  include RuleEngine::DSL
end

processor = ViolationProcessor.new
fraud_rules = processor.define_rule_set("fraud_detection") do
  rule "high_severity_fraud", priority: 100 do
    when { |context| context.severity >= 8 }
    suspend_account duration: "indefinite", reason: "High severity fraud"
    notify_support priority: :high
  end
end
```

### Configuration File
```yaml
fraud_detection:
  strategy: collect_all
  rules:
    - name: "high_severity_fraud"
      priority: 100
      condition:
        type: field_greater_than
        field: severity
        value: 8
      outcomes:
        - type: suspend_account
          duration: "indefinite"
```

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run all tests
bundle exec rspec

# Run specific tests
bundle exec rspec spec/simple_spec.rb

# Run examples
ruby simple_test.rb
ruby demo.rb
```

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for all core classes
- ✅ Integration tests for rule evaluation
- ✅ Transaction testing
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Performance tests
- ✅ DSL functionality tests

## 📊 Key Features Demonstrated

### 1. Flexible Rule Definition
- Rules can be defined programmatically or via configuration
- Support for complex conditions using logical operators
- Multiple outcomes per rule
- Priority-based rule ordering

### 2. Multiple Evaluation Strategies
- **First Match**: Stop at first matching rule
- **Collect All**: Evaluate all matching rules
- **Custom Strategies**: Stop on specific outcomes, limit outcomes, etc.

### 3. Transaction Support
- Rules can be executed within transaction scopes
- All outcomes collected and can be committed/rolled back together
