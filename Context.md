Flexible Rule Engine Architecture for Violation‑Based Actions
Introduction

A rule engine is a software component that evaluates business rules over data and returns decisions or events. It encapsulates if/then statements (rules) separately from the core application, making the system easier to maintain and evolve. InfoQ’s description of rule engines notes that they are essentially mechanisms for executing business rules, often phrased in if/then form, to drive decisions like discounts or insurance underwriting
infoq.com
. Rule engines use matching algorithms (for example, the Rete algorithm) to determine which rules to run and in what order
infoq.com
, and they allow the consequences of one rule to affect the facts and trigger further rules
infoq.com
. Because the rules are external to the application code, they can be updated or added without redeploying the whole system, improving agility and reusability
deviq.com
.

A typical architecture for a rule engine includes three parts: a rules engine component, a collection of rules, and the input/facts to which the rules are applied
deviq.com
. Each rule specifies a condition and an action; the engine evaluates the conditions against input data and executes the associated actions when conditions match. This pattern has multiple benefits: improved maintainability, increased flexibility, clear separation of concerns, and centralized management of business rules
deviq.com
.

When designing a rule engine to decide what and how many actions to take against configured violations, the architecture should support rule chaining, multiple outcomes and be flexible enough for dynamic requirements. The rest of this report proposes such an architecture and illustrates it with Ruby examples.

Architectural Principles for a Flexible Rule Engine
1. Separate Rules from Workflows

The rule engine should focus on evaluating conditions and producing knowledge or events, while workflows should perform the actual business work. Wikipedia’s design strategy section warns that mixing rules and workflows reduces reusability; business rules should produce knowledge (e.g., “violation is severe”) and workflows react to that knowledge (e.g., “suspend account”)
en.wikipedia.org
. Therefore, our architecture will:

Define rules purely as conditions and consequences that emit domain events (e.g., ViolationDetected, PenaltyCalculated).

Use separate action handlers or workflow services that subscribe to these events to perform side effects (e.g., sending notifications, blocking an account). This decouples decision logic from operations and allows reuse of rules in different workflows.

2. Use the Rules Engine Pattern with Supporting Patterns

The rules engine pattern includes a rules engine, a collection of rules and an input context
deviq.com
. When implementing a rule engine, DevIQ recommends that each rule follow the Single Responsibility Principle and remain simple
deviq.com
. The engine should accept a rules collection, apply rules to a given input, and process, aggregate or filter them based on business logic
deviq.com
.

Because violation handling often requires multiple actions in sequence or conditional branching, additional patterns are useful:

Chain of Responsibility – This pattern lets a request pass through a chain of handlers until one handles it or the chain ends. Each handler decides whether to process the request or pass it along
deviq.com
. Using chain-of-responsibility for rule execution enables ordered rule processing and dynamic composition of rule sequences. It also provides decoupling and reusability
deviq.com
.

Strategy – Different evaluation strategies (e.g., run all rules, run first-match) can be encapsulated as strategies. The rules engine can be configured to use a specific strategy depending on the domain context.

Command – Represent each action (side effect) as a command object. This allows actions to be queued, logged, retried or executed asynchronously, and provides a clean interface between decision and execution.

Observer/Mediator – Use observers or an event bus so that multiple workflows can react to rule outcomes. DevIQ notes that the observer pattern can be used to notify parties when rules are triggered
deviq.com
, and the mediator pattern can orchestrate interactions between the rules engine and its dependent components
deviq.com
.

3. Allow Rule Sets and Priorities

For complex violation handling, rules should be grouped into rule sets (e.g., “Fraud rules”, “Customer‑level rules”). Each rule can have a priority that determines its position in the chain or evaluation order. A ruleset helps manage configuration, enable/disable groups of rules and apply different policies for different violation types.

Because the chain‑of‑responsibility pattern allows dynamic ordering
deviq.com
, the engine can build a chain from the ruleset based on priorities or custom ordering. The engine then evaluates the chain either until the end or until a stopping condition occurs (e.g., first matching rule or aggregated outcomes).

4. Support Multiple Outcomes and Aggregated Results

Violation handling often triggers multiple actions. The engine should not only determine whether a rule matches, but also collect all relevant consequences. Rule outcomes can be aggregated into a list of events or commands. InfoQ notes that rule engines allow facts to be reconsidered by rules as they change, causing other rules to be run or cancelled
infoq.com
; thus, a flexible engine should handle cascading effects. To do this:

Each rule returns one or more outcome objects (e.g., AddPenalty, NotifySupport) rather than executing the action directly.

The engine aggregates outcomes from all applicable rules and returns them to the caller.

Action handlers consume the outcomes and perform operations. This design ensures that multiple outcomes from different rules can be executed in parallel or sequence.

5. Manage Rules as Configurable Data

A key benefit of business rule engines is agility—business stakeholders can modify rules without redeploying code
dev3lop.com
. To achieve this, rules should be stored in a configuration (YAML, JSON, database) and loaded at runtime. Each rule’s condition can be expressed in a domain-specific language or Ruby lambdas. The engine reads the configuration, builds rule objects and composes them into rule sets.

6. Provide Auditability and Governance

Rules often enforce compliance. Data transformation literature notes that rule engines enhance transparency and provide audit trails
dev3lop.com
. Therefore, the engine should log which rules fired and which actions were produced, with timestamps and input context. This helps debugging and regulatory compliance.

Proposed Architecture
Components

Violation Context – a data object representing the violation (type, severity, actor, timestamp, metadata). It acts as the input/facts for rule evaluation.

Rule – encapsulates:

Name/ID – unique identifier for configuration and logging.

Condition – a predicate (Proc or lambda) that takes a ViolationContext and returns true/false.

Outcomes – one or more outcome constructors to be produced if the condition matches. Outcomes may carry parameters (e.g., penalty amount).

Priority – optional value to order rule evaluation.

RuleSet – a collection of rules configured for a particular domain or violation type. The ruleset may define a strategy (e.g., evaluate all rules or stop at first match) and may support enabling/disabling rules.

RuleEngine – orchestrates rule evaluation:

load_rules(rule_set): loads rules from configuration and composes them into an internal structure (possibly a chain-of-responsibility).

evaluate(context): evaluates the ruleset against the ViolationContext. The evaluation strategy determines whether to continue after a match or to collect all matches. The engine returns a list of outcome events or commands.

hook/action dispatcher: after evaluation, the engine can optionally dispatch outcomes to registered handlers (mediator/observer). Alternatively, the caller can handle outcomes.

Outcome (Event/Command) – immutable objects representing the result of rule evaluation (e.g., AddPenalty, SuspendAccount, NotifyUser). Each outcome includes data needed to perform the action (e.g., penalty points). Actions should be implemented separately from the rule engine, enabling reuse and isolation.

Action Handlers/Workflows – services that subscribe to outcome events and execute business logic (e.g., update database, send emails). They can be implemented as command handlers or observer callbacks. Because workflows are separate from rules, multiple workflows can respond to the same rule outcome
en.wikipedia.org
.

Evaluation Flow

Input Preparation: Build a ViolationContext with details about the violation.

Rule Retrieval: The engine retrieves the appropriate RuleSet based on violation type or configuration.

Chain Construction: The engine orders rules by priority and composes them into a chain-of-responsibility. Each rule is a handler that checks its condition and either produces outcomes and, depending on the evaluation strategy, decides whether to pass control to the next handler.

Rule Evaluation:

The first rule handler receives the ViolationContext and calls its condition. If the condition is true, it constructs outcome objects and, depending on the strategy, either stops (first-match) or forwards the context to the next handler.

If the condition is false, it forwards the context without producing outcomes.

The process continues until the chain ends. The engine collects all outcomes produced.

Outcome Dispatch: The engine returns the list of outcomes. Action handlers subscribe to outcome types and execute operations. For example, a SuspendAccount handler will disable the user’s account and a NotifySupport handler will send an alert. The workflow can also decide to chain outcomes (e.g., after suspending the account, send a confirmation email).

Illustrative Ruby Implementation

The following Ruby code provides a simplified implementation of the proposed architecture. It shows how rules are defined declaratively, how the engine evaluates them using a chain-of-responsibility, and how multiple outcomes are collected.

# violation_context.rb
class ViolationContext
  attr_reader :type, :severity, :user_id, :metadata

  def initialize(type:, severity:, user_id:, metadata: {})
    @type = type
    @severity = severity
    @user_id = user_id
    @metadata = metadata
  end
end

# outcome.rb
# Base outcome class. Concrete outcomes inherit from this.
class Outcome
  attr_reader :context
  def initialize(context)
    @context = context
  end
end

class AddPenalty < Outcome
  attr_reader :points
  def initialize(context, points)
    super(context)
    @points = points
  end
end

class SuspendAccount < Outcome; end
class NotifySupport < Outcome; end

# rule.rb
class Rule
  attr_reader :name, :priority

  def initialize(name:, priority: 0, condition:, outcomes: [])
    @name      = name
    @priority  = priority
    @condition = condition      # -> (context) { boolean }
    @outcomes  = outcomes       # array of lambdas to build outcomes
    @next_rule = nil
  end

  # Link rules to form a chain (Chain of Responsibility)
  def next_rule=(rule)
    @next_rule = rule
  end

  # Evaluate the rule and collect outcomes.  When multiple
  # rules should fire, pass control to the next rule even after match.
  def evaluate(context, all_matches: true, collected: [])
    if @condition.call(context)
      # Build outcome objects
      @outcomes.each do |outcome_lambda|
        collected << outcome_lambda.call(context)
      end
      # If not collecting all matches, return immediately
      return collected unless all_matches
    end
    # Pass to next rule in the chain
    if @next_rule
      @next_rule.evaluate(context, all_matches: all_matches, collected: collected)
    else
      collected
    end
  end
end

# rule_set.rb
class RuleSet
  attr_reader :rules

  def initialize(rules)
    @rules = rules
  end

  # Build a chain-of-responsibility based on priority
  def to_chain
    sorted = @rules.sort_by { |r| -r.priority }
    sorted.each_cons(2) { |a, b| a.next_rule = b }
    sorted.first
  end
end

# rule_engine.rb
class RuleEngine
  def initialize(rule_sets)
    # rule_sets is a hash { name => RuleSet }
    @rule_sets = rule_sets
  end

  # Evaluate a specific ruleset by name
  # options: all_matches – whether to fire all matching rules
  def evaluate(rule_set_name, context, all_matches: true)
    rule_set = @rule_sets[rule_set_name]
    raise "Unknown ruleset: #{rule_set_name}" unless rule_set

    chain = rule_set.to_chain
    return [] unless chain

    outcomes = chain.evaluate(context, all_matches: all_matches, collected: [])
    log_fired_rules(outcomes)
    outcomes
  end

  private

  def log_fired_rules(outcomes)
    # simple logger; in production, include timestamps and rule names
    outcomes.each do |outcome|
      puts "[RULE FIRED] #{outcome.class.name} for context #{outcome.context.type}"
    end
  end
end

# Example usage
# Define some rules for a violation handling domain
rules = [
  Rule.new(
    name: "High severity suspension",
    priority: 10,
    condition: ->(ctx) { ctx.severity >= 8 },
    outcomes: [
      ->(ctx) { SuspendAccount.new(ctx) },
      ->(ctx) { NotifySupport.new(ctx) }
    ]
  ),
  Rule.new(
    name: "Medium severity penalty",
    priority: 5,
    condition: ->(ctx) { ctx.severity >= 5 && ctx.severity < 8 },
    outcomes: [
      ->(ctx) { AddPenalty.new(ctx, 10) }
    ]
  ),
  Rule.new(
    name: "Minor violation",
    priority: 1,
    condition: ->(ctx) { ctx.severity < 5 },
    outcomes: [
      ->(ctx) { AddPenalty.new(ctx, 3) }
    ]
  )
]

rule_set = RuleSet.new(rules)
engine   = RuleEngine.new({ default: rule_set })

# Simulate a violation
context1 = ViolationContext.new(type: :spam, severity: 9, user_id: 42)
context2 = ViolationContext.new(type: :spam, severity: 6, user_id: 50)
context3 = ViolationContext.new(type: :spam, severity: 2, user_id: 51)

outcomes1 = engine.evaluate(:default, context1, all_matches: true)
# => returns [SuspendAccount, NotifySupport]

outcomes2 = engine.evaluate(:default, context2, all_matches: true)
# => returns [AddPenalty(points: 10)]

outcomes3 = engine.evaluate(:default, context3, all_matches: true)
# => returns [AddPenalty(points: 3)]


In this example, rules are defined declaratively with conditions and outcome builders. The RuleSet orders the rules by priority and forms a chain. The RuleEngine evaluates the chain for a given context and collects outcomes. The design supports multiple outcomes (the high severity rule produces both SuspendAccount and NotifySupport outcomes) and rule chaining (medium and minor rules may still fire if all_matches is true). Because outcomes are separate from the rules, additional action handlers can be registered without changing the rule definitions.

Extended Features

The basic implementation can be extended in several ways:

Rule Sets per Violation Type: Different violation types may require different sets of rules. The engine can select a rule set based on the violation’s type.

Configurable Strategies: Provide strategies such as first‑match (stop after the first matching rule) or collect‑all. These strategies can be passed as parameters or implemented as separate evaluator classes.

External Configuration: Load rules from a YAML or JSON file. Each rule definition can include condition expressions (e.g., “severity >= 8”) that are evaluated using Ruby’s eval or a safer expression evaluator.

Rule Dependencies and Sub‑chains: Some rules may depend on the outcomes of other rules. By representing outcomes as events, subsequent rule sets can be triggered based on earlier results.

Auditing and Monitoring: Extend log_fired_rules to record rule execution details for auditing. Include timestamps, rule names, context details and resulting actions to meet compliance requirements
dev3lop.com
.

Testing and Validation: Provide DSLs or utilities to test rules independently. DevIQ suggests that rules may be swapped via methods and aggregated, and each rule should be simple
deviq.com
. Unit tests help validate individual rules without executing the entire engine.

Best Practices and Considerations

Keep Rules Simple and Focused: Each rule should have a single responsibility
deviq.com
. Complex logic can be composed via multiple rules rather than a monolithic condition.

Order and Prioritize Rules: Use priority values or dependencies to decide which rules execute first. The chain-of-responsibility pattern decouples the sender and receivers and allows dynamic handling
deviq.com
.

Avoid Hard‑Coding Actions within Rules: According to the design strategy separation
en.wikipedia.org
, embed only decision logic in rules; actual side effects should be separate. This increases reusability and testability.

Centralize Rule Management: Store rules in a central repository or configuration file. InfoQ notes that rule engines often manage rules separately from the application and allow them to be loaded at runtime
infoq.com
. Centralized management facilitates updates without redeploying the application and supports non‑technical users updating rules.

Design for Performance: While rule engines offer flexibility, they add overhead. InfoQ warns that rule engines schedule and match rules repeatedly
infoq.com
; thus, avoid expensive conditions inside rules and use indexing or caching when possible.

Provide Monitoring and Audit Trails: Business rules often involve compliance. Logging rule execution and outcomes provides transparency and ensures the system can be audited
dev3lop.com
.

Consider Reaction vs Production Rules: Wikipedia distinguishes forward‑chaining production rules (IF condition THEN action) and reactive event‑condition‑action rules
en.wikipedia.org
. If violation handling involves real‑time events (e.g., streaming logs), consider a reactive engine that triggers on incoming events and maintains state.

Conclusion

A flexible rule engine for violation‑based actions should separate decision logic from workflows, employ the rules engine pattern with supporting patterns (chain‑of‑responsibility, command, strategy, observer), support rule sets and priorities, allow multiple outcomes, and manage rules centrally. The proposed architecture uses a RuleEngine that loads configurable rules, builds a chain of handlers based on priority and evaluation strategy, evaluates rules against a violation context and produces outcome events. These outcomes are consumed by action handlers to perform business work. By following these principles and using the Ruby implementation as a starting point, you can develop a maintainable and extensible system that adapts quickly to changing policies.
